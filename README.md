# rn-notes-app

Notes App built with React Native.

## Note

This project works in combination with [JSON Server and ngrok](https://github.com/eneax/rn-notes-app-json-server).

Every time you start `ngrok`, you will get a new HTTP/TCP tunnel on random URLs/ports.
Use this URL as `baseURL` in `src/api/jsonServer.js`.

If you want to have custom subdomains and reserved domains, you have get the `ngrok` BASIC or PRO plan :)

## Run this project locally

```shell
npm i
npm start
```
